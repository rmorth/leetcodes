# [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

**_Difficulty:_** easy

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
