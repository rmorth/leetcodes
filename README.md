# Leetcodes

This repo aims to archive all of the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems I've solved. It follows the following structure:

1. Problem folder _(e.g two-sum)_
    1. README file
        1. Problem's details
        2. Difficulty _(stated in the platform)_
        3. Solution results
    2. Language folder _(e.g python)_
        1. Solution file(s)

## Why are you solving these?

I mostly solve these to solidify knowledge and for fun when I'm bored.

## Why are there no pictures of the solutions' results

Basically, they're useless! Sometimes I'd get a runtime of 60ms while other times I'd get 120ms, all with the same code. And honestly, becomes less of an hassle implementing solutions.
