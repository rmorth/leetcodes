# Leetcodes
This repo aims to archive all of the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems I've solved. With this goal, it follows the following structure:

1. Problem folder *(e.g two-sum)*
   1. README file
      1. Problem's details
      2. Difficulty *(stated in the platform)*
      3. Solution results
   2. Language folder *(e.g python)*
      1. Solution file(s)
      2. Submission image files

### Why are you solving these?

I mostly solve these to solidify knowledge and for fun when I'm bored.
